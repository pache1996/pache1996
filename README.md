 Hi, I'm Jaime. 

 I am going to introduce myself a little bit. I did a major in Mathematics and after that a master's degree in Statistical Techniques by the USC (not California's University, but Santiago de Compostela, Galicia, Spain). 

 My goal is to become a data scientist. Nevertheless, the formation I was given, differs from which companies specialized on this field look for. 

 Well, this github account borns with that goal: try to show that I am working on filling that Informatics, techie gap I know I have. For this reason, different repositories of several thematics will be displayed here: from databases (Oracle exercises in SQL/PLSQL or other ones) to Python or R machine learning projects.

 Feel free to write me or contact me as well as comment my work. 

 I hope you can learn something you when reading me! :)
